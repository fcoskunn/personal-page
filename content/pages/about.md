Hello! I'm Fatih, second year computer engineering student at Abdullah Gul University. Currently, I am working on AGU Non-Academic Transcript project besides my personal projects. Also, I have found opportunity to improve myself in different areas about software. Some of them are competitive programming, mobile programming and different software languages such as Scheme, Java and C++. In addition, I love traveling so much also, I am interested in computer science and philosophy.
